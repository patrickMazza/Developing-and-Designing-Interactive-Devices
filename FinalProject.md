# Final Project Emphatic Encapsulation

Sara Shin and Patrick Mazza

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 22

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 24

Functional check-off - November 30 & December 2

Final Project Presentations - December 7

Write-up and documentation due - December 13

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design. 

The goal of this project is to create an art installation that fully encapsulates an individual and makes them feel overwhelmed with emotion.

## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and test the interaction with people. 

This project is going to be an animatronic claw-like object that is 6 feet tall. The interior of this object is made of a mirror vinyl and the outside will look like a dragon with plastic scales. When the individual steps towards the device, it will open up and wait for the individual to enter. After the individual enters the device, it will close and encapsulate the individual. After five seconds, the contraption will open back up and the person can walk out. 


## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

Art installation that evokes the feelings of being overwhelmed, all-encompassing and emphatic. 
As people come close to the installation, the model will wrap around the person giving them an immersive experience. 

Timeline

11/14 - pick up motor and start working on linear

11/22 - finish making linear motor and begin testing the movement

11/29 - finalize movement and add exterior cover

Parts needed for project:

Metallic vinyl

polymer clay

plastic(?) or fabric(?) for exterior

parts to convert motor to linear motor

plastic tape to make the movement to be smoother



The fall back plan is to create a device that moves when someone approaches it. This means that if we cannot get the art installation to encapsulate the individual, we would still want it to present itself in a beautiful manner so individuals can appreciate the artwork and interact with it in a foundational manner.

5. Archive of all code, design patterns, etc. used in the final design. (As with labs, the standard should be that the documentation would allow you to recreate your project if you woke up with amnesia.)

5. Video of someone using your project

6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

7. Group work distribution questionnaire

## Change of Design

It is fine to change your project goals, but please resubmit the project plan for the new design when you do that.


## Teams

Sara Ghin, Patrick Mazza
You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
