# Final Project Emphatic Encapsulation

Sara Shin and Patrick Mazza

Using the tools and techniques you learned in this class, design, prototype and test an interactive device.

Project plan - November 22

Peer feedback on Project plans: November 24

Functional check-off - November 30 & December 2

Final Project Presentations - December 7

Write-up and documentation due - December 13

## Objective

The goal of this final project is for you to have a fully functioning and well-designed interactive device of your own design. 

The goal of this project is to create an art installation that fully encapsulates an individual and makes them feel overwhelmed with emotion.

## Description
Your project is to design and build an interactive device to suit a specific application of your choosing, and test the interaction with people. 

This project is going to be an animatronic claw-like object that is 6 feet tall. The interior of this object is made of a mirror vinyl and the outside will look like a dragon with plastic scales. When the individual steps towards the device, it will open up and wait for the individual to enter. After the individual enters the device, it will close and encapsulate the individual. After five seconds, the contraption will open back up and the person can walk out. 


## Deliverables

1. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

2. Project plan: Big idea, timeline, parts needed, fall-back plan.

Art installation that evokes the feelings of being overwhelmed, all-encompassing and emphatic. 
As people come close to the installation, the model will wrap around the person giving them an immersive experience. 

Timeline

11/14 - pick up motor and start working on linear

11/22 - finish making linear motor and begin testing the movement

11/29 - finalize movement and add exterior cover

Parts needed for project:

Metallic vinyl

polymer clay

plastic(?) or fabric(?) for exterior

parts to convert motor to linear motor

plastic tape to make the movement to be smoother



The fall back plan is to create a device that moves when someone approaches it. This means that if we cannot get the art installation to encapsulate the individual, we would still want it to present itself in a beautiful manner so individuals can appreciate the artwork and interact with it in a foundational manner.



# 3. Documentation of design process

<p>
This all got started when I took this picture that immediately seemed to overwhelm me. I coudn't look away, and it confused me how a photo could have such a strong reaction on me. I wanted to find a 3D shape/design that would invoke the same emotions without being too complicated in terms of movement. The movement needed to be "grasping" or "curling" towards the user and I remembered an instagram video of a teacher creating an octopus leg out of paper that could curl in and out.

# Prototyping of the cardboard base

<p>
From memory, I started cutting out pieces of paper and taping them together until I got to a shape and movement that I liked: 
</p>

<p>
  Initially, I imagined there to be multiple of this shape that would later be combined to make a flower or plant shape. 
This was just one of the designs I considered
</p>

<p>
  I then recreated the shape into cardboard and doubled the size. I messed around with the tip shape and ended up hating it. It looked too phallic and was not giving the shape I was looking for. 
</p>

<p>
As you can see, the prototype curled up nicely. It was at this stage I realized that the tape had to be tight on the back edge as to not allow the cardboard to flop to one side or the other as you could not open it up. Also, I was still considering the different angles I could play with to create the aforementioned plant or flower shape. I actually disliked the shape as a petal so decided to not make a flower. 
</p>

<p>I then doubled the size once again and changed the tip to match the original shape.</p>

I was looking at that size and knew it was still too small so I doubled it again

And immediately upon finishing it I knew it was once again too small... So I doubled it once again 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jWhuilv3EuqO9xhz1Xbh4h7CiEIJxLqu&usp=drive_copy

I was finally happy with the size of the curl but wanted the height to be taller so I cut of the bottom segmented piece and attached it to another full piece of cardboard. I used glue and scrap pieces of cardboard to strengthen the seam
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lkBrkGTe3LHqFor2pLLLwBzz36VtN89m&usp=drive_copy

I put the bottom piece back together with the top and it resulted in this 6 ft monstrosity

Once I was done with the shape, I turned my attention to the internal appearance. I initially wanted something subtley creeped out or slightly made the user feel claustrophobic. I began talking to different people at the lab for feedback or ideas and really pondered what felt right to the piece. I considered everything from a jungle to a more concrete feel, the flesh of an oyster to the inside of a bird beak. I took a 2 week break on this project seriously pondering what to do when Sebastian, the co-lab manager for the MakerLab had this reflective piece of plastic vinyl out. I initially considered it for another project I talked about doing with another friend. 

However, the longer I thought about it, I liked the idea of my installation showing a distorted view of the user. I tried putting it on top pieces and I loved the effect it gave. I eventually chose to cover the entire inside with it.

I will next discuss the exterior of the panels, but I would like to mention we started working on the motor and how to move the installation at this point and was done in conjunction. 

I wanted there to be a contrasting texture to the outside. I again considered a lot of different options. Making it look like sand or concrete to contrast against the very futuristic looking inside. I eventually landed the idea of scales and was inspired by reptiles and was planning to make it out of acrylic or fabric. However, I wasn't able to find fabric that I liked and I determined that acrylic would be too heavy for the already flimsy base. 

While I was still debating on the outside, I painted the outside with balck acrylic paint so no cardboard would show no matter what I put on top.

I then wondered at the remainder of the plastic vinyl I had and tried making a simple shape and mess with the curvature. I taped a couple pieces onto paper and got this
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T8JNrEJ6jEfwMXdaMvagj-yDyzkArhy1&usp=drive_copy

I actually enjoyed the shape so I started putting them on the piece. However, the tape was unable to maintan the curvature of the scale that I had enjoyed earlier and kept falling off. I remembered having experimented heating up the plastic on a different project and wondered if it would help in this case. It did. 

By putting the scales in this tube and heating it up with a heat gun, I was able to get the desired shape.

...and the lifting of the scales that I used wood tape to fix from this

...and combined them together using a soldering iron. Sadly don't have a picture of it but shown in the video

Patrick then worked on minimizing the angle of the motor movement. 

No pictures of this being done however the small prototype was spray painted with a texture spray and then a coat of black paint. Later a beak was painted on to mimic a penguin.

6. Reflections on process (What have you learned or wish you knew at the start?)

We created a prototype for this project because the large art instillation was too big to work with. We then made a smaller prototype with a smaller motor so it can be functional and work as a proof of concept. Originally, we tried many ways of moving the art contraption from using wires, a rolling mechanism and a scissor like motion. These proved too complicated or were ugly and rudementary in nature. Another porblem with all of these designs is that the motor device we were using was too small. This lead us to Dr. Ju providig us with a larger stepper motor so our overall design would work. This lead us to the design of proping the motor on one side of the art instillation to keep it steady, and have a lever where the motor can contol the other side of the art instillation. A really interesting aspect we learned from this prototype was that the surface on which we preformed the movement was imperitive on how the prototype preformed. This was due to the fact that on some surfaces the bottom of the art instillation would get stuck and stall, studder, or completly stop the motor. This lead to us putting little frictionless felt on the side of the art instillation that would move.

## Teams

Sara Ghin, Patrick Mazza
You can and are not required to work in teams. Be clear in documentation who contributed what. The total project contributions should reflect the number of people on the project.

## Examples

[Here is a list of good final projects from previous classes.](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/wiki/Previous-Final-Projects)
This version of the class is very different, but it may be useful to see these.
